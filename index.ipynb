Our goal here is just to give you a taste of what you'll be able to do as a Data Scientist, and afterwards, we'll go back and re-introduce all of the concepts that we skimmed over this time through. By the end of the section, you should have a much stronger understanding of this process - even if you have no previous programming experience.\n",

This can alternatively be replaced with double quotes `df[\"col_name\"]`. In general, anything in quotations is a string in Python code. Occasionally, with very ill formatted column names with quotations in the names themselves, you may even need to wrap a name in triple quotes `df[\"\"\"col_name\"\"\"]` . This will rarely happen in this particular context, but it's the general pattern for dealing with messy strings.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the second way, `df.col_name`, will only work if there are no spaces within the name of the column. Similar to tab completion with the command line, this is a primary reason why programmers use dashes (-) and underscores (_) in lieu of whitespace in their variable and file names. Also note that no quotations are used when using this format. (The column names have been stored as attributes of the DataFrame object!)"

    "There are a number of other packages you can also check out for visualization later on such as plotly, folium, and bokeh to name a few, but matplotlib is an industry standard used widely. As with the pandas package, we must import  the matplotlib package to use its built in functions and methods. Rather then import the entire package however, we import only the piece we intend to use (hence the dot notation) and again alias this under the shorthand *plt*. Finally, the Jupyter magic command **% matplotlib inline** makes these graphs appear within our jupyter notebook."
